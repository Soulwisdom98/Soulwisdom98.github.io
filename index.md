### CPSC 120

Lab 8, part 1 is one of my three favorites because I love sandwiches and thought it was pretty funny that we could do some code about it. Like how it got me to learn about siring if statements to make sure you have the appropriate amount of arguments.


Lab 6, part 2 is one of my three favorites because I got to learn about black jack and how it works which was nice. Writing the functions in it was pretty fun.


Lab 3, part 1 is one of my three favorites because pizza is my favorite junk food to eat at home and marking a code that works like a cashier was cool and a fun experience to have done.
